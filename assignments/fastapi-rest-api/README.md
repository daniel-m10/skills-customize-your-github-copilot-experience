# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Install FastAPI and Uvicorn, and create a basic FastAPI application with a root endpoint.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., main.py)
- Implement a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message in JSON

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a simple resource (e.g., items).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items
- Use request and response models with Pydantic
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses
- Handle errors gracefully

### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using an HTTP client (such as curl, httpie, or Postman) and document example requests and responses.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Provide example requests for each endpoint
- Show expected JSON responses
- Include instructions for running and testing the API
